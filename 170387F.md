# Concepts learned about Blockchains

## 1. Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchains 

In permissionless blockchains anyone can participate and all the participants are anonymous. This lack of identity of the users in the blockchain creates a lack of trust about the blockchain. To overcome this issue, permissionless blockchains provide a incentive with a financial value as a benefit. On the other hand, permissioned blockchains are shared by users with known identities but  these users may have trust issues even though they share a common goal.


## 2. Smart contracts

Smart contract is an application or a code in the blockchain which has the business logic that governs a certain asset in the blockchain.
